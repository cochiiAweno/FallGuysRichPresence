5. Open your game, execute the presence and the program will ask you for your Application ID, Fall Guys in-game name and the name of the logo that you uploaded (if you use my logo the name is logo_s5)
6. Now in your Discord profile you'll have the round that you're playing and the name of your Fall Guy. To stop the presence follow the instructions that appear in the program
